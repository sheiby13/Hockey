						<p>NFT Hockey started in December 2021, when three of us, Kostiantyn Ostapenko, Aleksey Pitenko and Sergey Kalugin went through the Near.Hack in Kyiv. For all of us, it was a big challenge as first experience in crypto. And we took the prize!</p>
					</br>
						<p> <img class="history-img" src="img/history-img.jpg" alt="">When we came back to Kharkiv, we started assembling a team. We have grown fast, now we have not only programmers but also UI/UX designers, game designers, 2D and 3D artists.
						We are inspired by the opportunity to develop something new and by chance of creation, and popularization of a new trend in GameFi in particular and the gaming industry in general.
						</p>
					</br>
						<p> Our platform consists of three parts. They are shop and marketplace, managers department, and gameplay. Every object in our game will be presented as NFT.
						At the marketplace, you will have an opportunity to buy, sell and exchange player cards. We are going to implement crypto-processes as game mechanics, such as minting, lending, NFT-staking, creating an NFT from a couple of others, etc. So you, as a team manager will have plenty of operations to improve your players and game results. And, during the PvP or PvE game, you perform as a coach and do all the staff on the bench.</p>
